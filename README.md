Backbone.js Test Server with Dancer2 and DBIx::Class


Based on the (excellent) Backbone.js [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZSjvWtUxYk) from Thomas Davis,
BBTS is a test server written in Perl which uses Dancer2 to serve the REST requests and DBIx::Class to store the data
in an SQLite database.

The html+javascript code is entirely in public/index.html.
The server part is in lib/BBTS.pm
